			/*  The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

			    What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

					just solve for numbers smaller than 1,000
					and don't worry about making it efficient.
					You won't need to do any crazy math -- 
					think iteration and make the computer do the work. 
					Consider it extra credit to make your solution solve 
					for larger numbers in a way that isn't too slow.  */
